                Nikolas Draper-Ivey is an American illustrator based outside of New York City.
                 Born in Lansing, Michigan in 1991. 
                 He grew up in Detroit, where his father first exposed him to Japanese animation with Katsuhiro Otomo’s Akira.
                  In his adolescence he discovered Shonen Jump Magazine.  
                  This inspired him to pursue a career as a professional illustrator.  
                  In 2010 he began his first semester at Savannah College Of Art & Design (SCAD) in Georgia as a Sequential Art major with a minor in Illustration.

                His style plays heavily on use of light and shadow and combines afro-futurist elements with hints of fantasy, hip-hop and punk culture and his love of cinematography.
                His two biggest influences are Roger Deakins (Director of cinematography for Blade Runner 2049) and Takeshi Obata, 
                (artist for Hikaru No Go, Death Note, BAKUMAN Platinum End).  
                In 2014, after moving to New York City, he had the chance to meet with his idols, 
                Editor Koji Yoshida and mangaka Takeshi Obata who praised his early works as a “successful fusion of his Eastern and Western influences”.

                He further experimented with this blend with this first serialized work: XOGENASYS.
                In a short span of time his artwork has become a source of inspiration to many artists in the black community.
                This recognition afforded him the opportunity to create album artwork for MARVEL’S “BLACK PANTHER: THE ALBUM”, Produced by Kendrick Lamar.

                Currently, Draper-Ivey is working on his original work Dream Vesper, he firmly believes that his unique Afro-Asian futuristic art style can change the world.
